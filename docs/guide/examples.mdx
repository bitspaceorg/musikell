# Examples

## What You'll Learn

- How to read and understand complete `.mkl` programs
- Common patterns for different use cases
- How concepts from the guide come together in practice

## Prerequisites

- All previous guide sections, especially [Nodes](nodes.mdx), [Routing](routing.mdx), and [Effects](effects.mdx)

## Example Programs

| Example                                       | Description                    | Concepts Used                               |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| [hello-sine.mkl](examples/hello-sine.mkl)     | Basic sine wave output         | Creational node, input/output               |
| [drum-machine.mkl](examples/drum-machine.mkl) | Beat sequencer with effects    | Sequencer, noise, filter, mix               |
| [vocal-chain.mkl](examples/vocal-chain.mkl)   | Input processing chain         | Filter, compressor, reverb                  |
| [live-rig.mkl](examples/live-rig.mkl)         | Complex live performance setup | Groups, feedback, conditional, multi-output |

## hello-sine.mkl

The simplest Musikell program. Generates a 440 Hz sine wave and writes it to stdout.

```mkl
input stdin
osc = Creational.Oscillator<Sine>(freq=440)
output osc
```

**Key points:**

- `input stdin` is required even if the program does not read external audio.
- `Creational.Oscillator<Sine>` generates audio from nothing.
- `output osc` designates which node writes to stdout.

Run it: `musikell run hello-sine.mkl | aplay -f FLOAT_LE -r 44100 -c 1`

## drum-machine.mkl

A simple drum machine with kick and hi-hat patterns using the Sequencer kernel.

```mkl
input stdin

kick_seq = Creational.Sequencer(pattern=|x...x...x...x...|, bpm=120, subdivision=4)
kick_osc = Creational.Oscillator<Sine>(freq=60)
kick = Manipulative<kick_osc, kick_seq>.Gain(level=0.8)

hat_seq = Creational.Sequencer(pattern=|..x...x...x...x.|, bpm=120, subdivision=4)
hat_noise = Creational.Noise<White>(seed=42)
hat_filtered = Manipulative<hat_noise>.Filter<HP>(cutoff=8000, resonance=0.3)
hat = Manipulative<hat_filtered, hat_seq>.Gain(level=0.4)

mix = Manipulative<kick, hat>.Mix()
output mix
```

**Key points:**

- Sequencer outputs a gate signal (1.0 or 0.0), not audio.
- The gate is multiplied with an audio source via `Gain` to produce rhythmic sound.
- Kick uses a low sine oscillator (60 Hz). Hi-hat uses high-passed white noise.
- `Mix` sums the two signals.

## vocal-chain.mkl

A processing chain for vocal input: high-pass filter, compressor, and reverb.

```mkl
input mic

filtered = Manipulative<mic>.Filter<HP>(cutoff=80, resonance=0.5)
compressed = Manipulative<filtered>.Dynamics<Compressor>(
  threshold=-18, ratio=4, attack=5, release=50, makeup=6
)
wet = Manipulative<compressed>.Reverb(room=0.6, decay=1.5, damping=0.4, mix=0.25)

output wet
```

**Key points:**

- The high-pass filter at 80 Hz removes low-frequency rumble and handling noise.
- The compressor evens out dynamic range with a 4:1 ratio.
- Reverb adds space with a 25% wet mix.
- Order matters: filter before compression before reverb is a standard vocal chain.

## live-rig.mkl

A complex live performance setup with multiple inputs, groups, conditional routing, beat sequencing, and multiple outputs. This example demonstrates most of Musikell's features working together.

See the full source at [examples/live-rig.mkl](examples/live-rig.mkl).

**Key points:**

- Four input channels (vocal, guitar, drums, synth) and four output destinations (main speakers, stage monitor, engineer headphones, recording bus).
- Groups organize processing chains (vocal_chain, guitar_chain, drum_chain, synth_chain).
- Conditional routing dynamically selects reverb size based on signal amplitude.
- Feedback edges on the master bus add subtle saturation.
- A drum machine group with multiple patterns runs alongside live drum input.
- Separate monitor and headphone mixes with different balances.

## Summary

These examples progress from the simplest possible program (hello-sine) through practical processing chains (vocal-chain, drum-machine) to a full live performance rig. Each example builds on concepts from the guide: creational and manipulative nodes, routing, effects, patterns, and conditional logic.

## Next Steps

- Try modifying the examples and listening to the results
- Combine techniques from different examples into your own programs
- Refer back to individual guide sections for parameter details
