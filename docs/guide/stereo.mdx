# Stereo

## What You'll Learn

- The difference between mono and stereo signals in Musikell
- How to access individual channels with `.L` and `.R`
- How to convert mono signals to stereo
- How to merge separate left and right channels back to interleaved stereo

## Prerequisites

- [Concepts](concepts.mdx) -- understanding of buffers and blocks
- [Nodes](nodes.mdx) -- understanding of Manipulative nodes

## Channel Count

Every node in Musikell produces either a **mono** (1 channel) or **stereo** (2 channel) signal. The channel count is determined by the kernel and its configuration.

| Channels   | Buffer layout           | Description                                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Mono (1)   | `[s0, s1, s2, ...]`     | Single channel, 256 samples per block         |
| Stereo (2) | `[L0, R0, L1, R1, ...]` | Interleaved left/right, 512 samples per block |

Most kernels default to mono. The `Channel` kernel handles conversions between mono and stereo.

## Accessing Individual Channels

Use dot access to extract the left or right channel from a stereo signal:

### Syntax

```mkl
left = signal.L
right = signal.R
```

### Example

```mkl
input stereo_in

-- Split stereo input into separate channels
left = stereo_in.L
right = stereo_in.R

-- Process each channel differently
left_filtered = Manipulative<left>.Filter<LP>(cutoff=2000, resonance=0.5)
right_filtered = Manipulative<right>.Filter<LP>(cutoff=4000, resonance=0.5)
```

`.L` extracts sample indices 0, 2, 4, ... from the interleaved buffer. `.R` extracts indices 1, 3, 5, ... Both produce mono signals.

## Mono to Stereo

The `monoToStereo` operation duplicates a mono signal to both left and right channels:

```mkl
osc = Creational.Oscillator<Sine>(freq=440)
stereo_osc = Manipulative<osc>.Channel<MonoToStereo>()
```

The resulting signal has the same content in both channels. This is useful when you need to feed a mono source into a stereo processing chain.

### Panning

To create a stereo image from a mono source, convert to stereo and then adjust channel levels:

```mkl
osc = Creational.Oscillator<Sine>(freq=440)
stereo = Manipulative<osc>.Channel<MonoToStereo>()

-- Pan slightly left by reducing the right channel
left = stereo.L
right = stereo.R
right_quiet = Manipulative<right>.Gain(level=0.3)
```

## Channel Merge

To combine separate left and right mono signals back into a single interleaved stereo signal:

```mkl
merged = Manipulative<left_signal, right_signal>.Channel<Merge>()
```

### Example: Split, Process, Merge

```mkl
input stereo_in

-- Split
left = stereo_in.L
right = stereo_in.R

-- Process independently
left_proc = Manipulative<left>.Reverb(room=0.4, decay=1.0, damping=0.5, mix=0.2)
right_proc = Manipulative<right>.Reverb(room=0.6, decay=1.5, damping=0.3, mix=0.3)

-- Merge back to stereo
stereo_out = Manipulative<left_proc, right_proc>.Channel<Merge>()
output stereo_out
```

This creates a wider stereo image by applying different reverb settings to each channel.

## Mid/Side Processing

A common technique is to convert stereo to mid/side, process, and convert back:

```mkl
input stereo_in

-- Extract channels
left = stereo_in.L
right = stereo_in.R

-- Derive mid (L+R) and side (L-R) -- requires a custom kernel or math node
-- This is an advanced pattern shown for illustration
mid = Manipulative<left, right>.Mix()
-- side processing would require subtraction (not yet a builtin)

output mid
```

Full mid/side processing requires arithmetic operations that are planned for a future release.

## Summary

Musikell supports mono and stereo signals. Stereo buffers use interleaved layout. Use `.L` and `.R` to access individual channels from a stereo signal. Use `Channel<MonoToStereo>` to duplicate a mono signal to both channels. Use `Channel<Merge>` to combine separate left and right signals back to interleaved stereo.
