# First Program

## What You'll Learn

- How to write a minimal `.mkl` program
- What each line means
- How to run the program and hear the output

## Prerequisites

- Musikell built and available (see [Installation](guide-installation))
- An audio playback tool (`aplay`, `sox`, `ffplay`, or similar)

## Hello Sine

Create a file called `hello-sine.mkl`:

```mkl
-- hello-sine.mkl
-- Generate a 440 Hz sine wave

input stdin
osc = Creational.Oscillator<Sine>(freq=440)
output osc
```

### Line by Line

**`-- hello-sine.mkl`** -- Lines starting with `--` are comments. They are ignored by the parser.

**`input stdin`** -- Declares an input node named `stdin`. Every Musikell program needs at least one input declaration. This binds the program's standard input stream to a node you can reference later (though in this example we do not use it).

**`osc = Creational.Oscillator<Sine>(freq=440)`** -- This is a binding. It creates a node named `osc` using:

- `Creational` -- the node type. Creational nodes generate audio from nothing (no input signal required).
- `Oscillator` -- the kernel. This is the DSP function that runs every block.
- `<Sine>` -- the oscillator variant. Other options include `Saw`, `Square`, and `Triangle`.
- `(freq=440)` -- the parameter list. Here we set the frequency to 440 Hz (concert A).

**`output osc`** -- Declares an output node. The signal from `osc` is written to stdout as raw PCM every block.

## Running It

### Linux (aplay)

```bash
musikell run hello-sine.mkl | aplay -f FLOAT_LE -r 44100 -c 1
```

### Linux / macOS (sox)

```bash
musikell run hello-sine.mkl | sox -t raw -r 44100 -e floating-point -b 32 -c 1 - -d
```

### macOS (ffplay)

```bash
musikell run hello-sine.mkl | ffplay -f f32le -ar 44100 -ac 1 -nodisp -
```

You should hear a continuous 440 Hz tone -- concert pitch A4.

## Experimenting

Try changing the frequency:

```mkl
osc = Creational.Oscillator<Sine>(freq=261.63)
```

This produces middle C (C4). Or switch to a different waveform:

```mkl
osc = Creational.Oscillator<Saw>(freq=440)
```

A sawtooth wave at 440 Hz has a brighter, buzzier timbre than a sine wave because it contains all harmonics.

## Summary

You wrote a three-line Musikell program that generates a sine wave oscillator and routes it to stdout. The program declares an input, creates a creational node with a kernel and parameters, and declares an output.

## Next Steps

- [Concepts](guide-concepts) -- understand nodes, edges, blocks, and the execution pipeline
- [Nodes](guide-nodes) -- learn about all three node types
