Early design notes and specifications. These documents capture initial design decisions. For current documentation, see the [Reference](../reference.mdx) and [Architecture](../architecture.mdx) sections.

| Document                                    | Description                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| [Grammar Snippets](grammar/snippets/v1.mkl) | Early `.mkl` syntax examples   |
| [CLI Design](rewrite-struct.txt)            | Config, run, backend switching |

**Note:** Node specifications previously in `design/nodes/` have been consolidated into [Architecture — Node Model](../architecture/node-model.mdx).
