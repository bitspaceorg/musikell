Like the title says, the goal of Musikell is to create a modular audio engine designed to run on barest of the metals.

At the moment, All we have is a vision, a group of people who love art, and a bit of hope that this will change how we consume and process art at the native level.

Until we’ve got an update to share, check out our other projects on [bitspace::gitlab](https://gitlab.com/bitspaceorg).
