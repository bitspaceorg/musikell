Core layer: graph model, execution plan, deterministic scheduling.

## Pipeline

```
Graph → ExecutionPlan → ResolvedPlan → Scheduler
        (topo sort)     (zero-alloc)   (hot path)
```

## Modules

| Module                                         | Description                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Types](reference-core-types)                  | Foundation types: NodeId, PortId, KernelId, BlockSize, error types |
| [Node](reference-core-node)                    | Port, NodeSpec — node model with channel support                   |
| [Graph](reference-core-graph)                  | DAG representation with forward and feedback edges                 |
| [ExecutionPlan](reference-core-execution-plan) | Topologically sorted execution order (Kahn's algorithm)            |
| [ResolvedPlan](reference-core-resolved-plan)   | Pre-resolved plan — zero allocation in the hot path                |
| [Scheduler](reference-core-scheduler)          | Block-based deterministic scheduler with two execution modes       |
