Core layer: graph model, execution plan, deterministic scheduling.

## Pipeline

```
Graph → ExecutionPlan → ResolvedPlan → Scheduler
        (topo sort)     (zero-alloc)   (hot path)
```

## Modules

| Module                                   | Description                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Types](core/types.mdx)                  | Foundation types: NodeId, PortId, KernelId, BlockSize, error types |
| [Node](core/node.mdx)                    | Port, NodeSpec — node model with channel support                   |
| [Graph](core/graph.mdx)                  | DAG representation with forward and feedback edges                 |
| [ExecutionPlan](core/execution-plan.mdx) | Topologically sorted execution order (Kahn's algorithm)            |
| [ResolvedPlan](core/resolved-plan.mdx)   | Pre-resolved plan — zero allocation in the hot path                |
| [Scheduler](core/scheduler.mdx)          | Block-based deterministic scheduler with two execution modes       |
